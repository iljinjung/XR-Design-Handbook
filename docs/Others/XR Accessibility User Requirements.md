# XR Accessibility User Requirements
Original article: [XR Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/)

## TL;DR
This document outlines accessibility needs for XR. The focus is on inclusivity for users with disabilities through features like motion-agnostic interactions, voice commands, and customization. XR's broad applications require addressing challenges to ensure accessibility for diverse disabilities and integrating guidelines like WCAG and WebXR API for a universally inclusive experience.

## Bullet points
1. üï∂Ô∏è **XR Definition & Diversity**: XR, or Extended Reality, encompasses a broad range of immersive technologies. It's not limited to just one experience but includes a variety of hardware, applications, and techniques. The term emphasizes the diverse nature of these technologies and the increasing emphasis on making them accessible to all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.

2. üåê **XR's Spectrum**: XR is not limited to just gaming or education; it spans across multiple domains. It covers everything from head-mounted displays used in immersive virtual worlds to mobile devices with tracking capabilities that augment our real-world surroundings. The possibilities within this spectrum are vast and constantly evolving.

3. üîß **Accessibility Challenges**: As with all technological advancements, XR comes with its set of challenges, especially regarding accessibility. It's essential for designers and developers to understand the nuances of XR and ensure they address the needs of all users, including those with disabilities. Often, there's a gap in knowledge or lack of access to resources that can inform better, more inclusive design.

4. üéÆ **Disability in Gaming**: The gaming landscape in XR presents specific challenges for users with disabilities. From games that heavily rely on motion controls to VR headsets that necessitate certain physical postures, the realm is rife with barriers. There's also the issue of manufacturers locking certain games to specific hardware, further limiting accessibility.

5. üîä **Categories of Disabilities**: When addressing accessibility in XR, it's vital to consider the broad spectrum of disabilities, which includes auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual. Each category has its unique needs, and XR solutions should strive to accommodate them.

6. üîë **Multimodality in XR**: At the core of XR is the concept of multimodality. Rather than relying on a single sense or mode of interaction, XR leverages multiple senses, enhancing the experience. Whether it's sight, sound, touch, or even smell and taste in some advanced applications, XR aims to create a holistic, immersive experience.

7. üéõÔ∏è **Input and Output Challenges**: A fundamental aspect of XR is how users interact with and receive feedback from the system. Input methods vary widely, from traditional means like keyboards to advanced methods like eye tracking. On the other hand, XR outputs can be as varied as tactile feedback, auditory cues, or even simulated smells and tastes in cutting-edge applications.

8. üåè **Affordances in XR**: Affordances in the world of XR refer to the potential actions a user can perform. It's not just about what's possible but also about what's intuitive and accessible. When a user sees a virtual object, it should be evident how they can interact with it, regardless of their abilities.

9. üîì **WCAG & WebXR**: The integration of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) with the WebXR API underscores the movement toward making virtual and augmented reality experiences on the web universally accessible. This collaboration ensures that as the web embraces XR, it does so with inclusivity at its core.
    
10. üîç **Immersive Semantics and Customization**: Users employing assistive technology seek intuitive navigation, accurate object identification, and interaction within XR environments. This entails robust affordances for navigation and accurate descriptions understood by assistive tech, as well as customizable controls, object filtering, and querying.

11. ü§ñ **Motion Agnostic Interactions**: People with physical disabilities require interactions in XR that are independent of bodily movement. This involves enabling device-independent actions, ensuring uniform access across the interface, and accommodating multiple input methods to cater to various needs.

12. üé® **Immersive Personalization**: Users with cognitive and learning disabilities require personalizing XR experiences. This includes support for symbol sets layered over objects, the ability to mute non-critical content, and accommodating personal preferences.

13. üéØ **Interaction and Target Customization**: Individuals with limited mobility or vision challenges may need larger target sizes for controls. Meeting these needs involves fine motion control avoidance, adequate spacing around hit targets, and minimizing actions or gestures required for tasks.

14. üéôÔ∏è **Voice Commands**: Users with limited mobility benefit from controlling XR through voice commands. This requires navigation and interaction via voice activation, ideally integrated with native screen readers or voice assistants.

15. üé®** Color Changes**: Addressing the needs of color-blind users, customization of colors in XR environments is crucial for better understanding controls, affordances, and warnings. This entails providing high-contrast options based on luminosity and color contrast requirements.

16. üîç **Magnification Context and Resetting**: Users relying on screen magnification need to understand their view context. This involves allowing users to check and reset view context, along with enlarging interface elements where necessary.

17. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Messaging and Alerts**: Screen magnification users must be made aware of critical messages without losing focus. This may involve prioritizing these alerts for assistive technology understanding and potentially routing them to a second screen device.

18. üë• **Gestural Interfaces and Interactions**: Blind users might want to interact with gestures in XR. This includes support for touch screen accessibility gestures, a self-voicing option for virtual menus, and remapping gestures for different actions.

19. üì£ **Signing Videos and Text Description Transformation**: Deaf or hard of hearing individuals may prefer sign language in XR. This involves allowing text, objects, or descriptions to be presented via pre-recorded signing avatars, which should align with specific size recommendations based on research.

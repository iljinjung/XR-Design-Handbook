# Prompt I use
Inspired by [The best youtube summary prompt I've come up with](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11pd4sl/the_best_youtube_summary_prompt_ive_come_up_with/)

## Starting prompt
- Creating a concise summary of the educational blog post using its documention to supply college student notes to use himself. Use keywords from the document. Don't explain them. Keywords will be explained later. You are to act like an expert in the subject the documention is written about.

- Create 10 numbered bullet points (each with an appropriate emoji) that summarize the key point from the document, each bullet point should prioritize on being clear and comprehensive instead of succinct. Elaborate on each bullet point wherever possible. You are to act like an expert in the subject the documention is written about.

- Extract the most important keywords and any complex words not known to the average reader as well as any acronyms mentioned. For each keyword and complex word, provide an explanation and definition based on its occurrence in the document.

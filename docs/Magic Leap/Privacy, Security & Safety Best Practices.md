# Privacy, Security & Safety Best Practices
Original article: [Privacy, Security & Safety Best Practices](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/guides/best-practices/privacy-security-safety)

## TL;DR
Developers for Magic Leap 2 must prioritize user privacy, security, and safety. Transparent data practices, minimal data collection, and robust user support are key. While Magic Leap offers essential tools, developers are responsible for proper implementation and maintaining user trust.

## Bullet points
1. **📜 Compliance & Standards**: Adhere to all applicable laws and industry standards, avoiding the use of unlicensed intellectual property.

2. **🛡️ Data Privacy Disclosure**: Offer a clear privacy policy detailing data usage, retention policies, and sharing mechanisms, updating it for any new practices or features.

3. **🖐️ User Permission**: Obtain permission prior to accessing any user data, ensuring default settings prioritize privacy, and provide contextual clarity about the need for permissions.

4. **📉 Data Minimization**: Limit data collection to only what's necessary, anonymizing and aggregating where feasible, and restricting unrelated data combinations.

5. **🔒 Security-centric Approach**: Prioritize data security at each stage of application development, employing encryption and only using documented APIs.

6. **📲 Safe Storage**: Store non-confidential data internally and use secure storage APIs for sensitive information, refraining from logging data unnecessarily.

7. **🌐 Third-party Code Due Diligence**: Exercise caution when incorporating third-party code, ensuring it doesn’t compromise security.

8. **💡 Safety Protocols**: Offer safety indicators and warnings, prevent possible harm scenarios, and conduct risk assessments for potential application hazards.

9. **🔧 Device Intended Use**: Ensure the application’s usage aligns with the device’s primary purpose, notifying users of any system setting changes.

10. **📞 Support Availability**: Offer communication avenues for user queries and feedback without redirecting them to Magic Leap for app-specific concerns.
    
## Keywords
- **Magic Leap 2**: A device/platform. In the context, it seems to be a technology device with capabilities like eye-tracking and spatial mapping.

- **Eye Tracking Data**: Information about where a user is looking on a device screen or within a virtual environment.

- **Spatial Maps**: Digital representations of physical environments. In this context, it refers to potentially sensitive layouts of workspaces or areas.

- **Anonymized**: Data that is stripped of personal identifiers, making it impossible to trace back to the original source.

- **Aggregated**: Data that's combined from several measurements. In privacy, it's often used to generalize datasets so individuals cannot be easily identified.

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Information that can be used to identify an individual either by itself or with other data.

- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: Sets of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: A cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

- **Penetration Testing**: An authorized cyber attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate its security.

# A Concise Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Apple Vision Pro Design & Development
Original article: [A Concise Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Apple Vision Pro Design & Development](https://www.roadtovr.com/apple-vision-pro-design-development-beginner-guide-sterling-crispin/)

## TL;DR
The document introduces visionOS, Apple's XR headset, with features like spatial audio and tool compatibility. It provides guidelines for spatial computing, including VR and AR, focusing on user sensory considerations and design principles. The text also highlights spatial computing weaknesses and emphasizes rapid development strategies, offering insights for developers in immersive technologies.

## Bullet points
1. üñºÔ∏è **Scenes in visionOS (Windows, Volumes, and Spaces)**: visionOS organizes applications into three types of spatial contexts: Windows, Volumes, and Spaces. Windows are rectangular displays akin to traditional computer screens, while Volumes represent 3D or interactive objects, and Spaces are immersive environments that provide full control. Immersion styles within Spaces may vary from mixed to full, defining the extent of the real world to be seen.
2. üéÆ **User Input and Interaction Methods**: Users can interact with visionOS using various methods, from traditional gestures like pinching and tapping on floating windows to using Bluetooth trackpads or game controllers. Voice input and Dwell Control are also available. Developers need not worry about the origin of these events, focusing on handling them through elements like TapGesture.
3. üéß **Spatial Audio in Vision Pro**: Vision Pro's advanced spatial audio system gives a realistic sound experience by considering the room's physical attributes. Developers must prioritize using sound design for UI interaction and creating immersive experiences, acknowledging the importance of spatial audio in enhancing the user experience.
4. üõ†Ô∏è **Development Tools and Platforms**: Depending on the target platforms, developers can choose between Apple's development ecosystem (using tools like XCode, SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit, and Reality Composer Pro) or Unity for building fully immersive VR experiences that are compatible with various headsets. Apple's tools enable quick development with built-in assets, while Unity offers more extensive control and compatibility with non-Apple VR systems.
5. üì≤ **Transitioning iOS Apps and Product Design Considerations**: Existing iOS apps can transition to visionOS as floating Windows, with the Ornament API allowing customization. Understanding spatial apps requires experiencing them firsthand (e.g., through Quest 2 or 3), and keeping a learning diary can be invaluable. Thoughtful design, understanding user needs, and avoiding overly complex or physically demanding interactions are paramount.
6. üìê **Prototyping and Spatial Formats**: The design process for spatial apps may involve physical prototyping with paper or cardboard, or digital tools like ShapesXR. The app's purpose should be reflected in its spatial arrangements, with consideration for user comfort and familiarity. High-end tools like the Varjo XR-3 might be considered for those with substantial budgets. The prototyping phase emphasizes user-centric design, ensuring the application's spatial components align with user needs and expectations while exploring various interaction models.
7. 1. üß† **Visual and Perceptual Comfort:** The design of spatial computing interfaces should prioritize the sensory experience of the user. Ergonomics and cognitive impacts must be considered to minimize discomfort and motion sickness. Users may attribute discomfort to hardware, but it's the app's responsibility to ensure comfort.
8. üé® **UI and Web Design:** A blend of standard practices and innovation is key for intuitive interaction. Using tools like WebXR, designers can turn websites into immersive VR experiences. A balance between subtlety in space and motion and avoiding excessive 3D effects is essential.
9. üéÆ **Games and Media Development:** Choices of tools like Unity or Apple's ecosystem can significantly impact the development process. Varied contexts for gameplay mechanics, mixed inputs, and asymmetry should be explored. Existing tools like Apple's Game Porting Toolkit could facilitate the integration of high-end PC games.
10. üè¢ **Strengths, Weaknesses, and Strategies for Spatial Computing in Business and Products:** Spatial computing's strength lies in teaching spatial tasks, viewing things at scale, expressive applications, and immersive media. Limitations exist in activities involving quick movements and long-term use. A lean approach to development that encourages fast failure, pivots, and focuses on solving real problems can lead to success. For existing products, the focus should be on identifying specific spatial moments that enhance the experience while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

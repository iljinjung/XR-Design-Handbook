# Principles of Spatial Design
Original Video: [Principles of Spatial Design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10072/)


## TL;DR
This video transcript focuses on the principles of spatial design for a spatial operating system on the Apple platform. It covers topics such as window design, size flexibility, multiple windows, human-centered design, dimensionality, immersion, and user comfort. The aim is to create familiar, authentic, and immersive experiences for users within the spatial environment.


## Bullet Points
- 🧭 Design spatial apps that balance familiarity and new possibilities. Use elements like sidebars and tabs to help users navigate and find what they're looking for. 
- 🪟 Windows in spatial design have a new visual language, with glass material for contrast and adaptability to different lighting conditions. 
- 📏 Size and shape flexibility in windows allows for comfortable viewing and accommodation of different types of content. Use tab bars and toolbars to extend beyond the window. 
- 📐 Points system is used to ensure scalable and legible interface elements at different distances. Design interfaces with points to adapt to various screen sizes. 
- 👤 Human-centered design is essential in spatial apps. Consider the user's field of view, design with ergonomics in mind, and place content relative to the user's head and position. 
- 🌌 Dimension and immersion are key in spatial design. Utilize the space around users, leverage depth and scale to create hierarchy and focus, and design immersive experiences beyond windows. 
- 🔄 Immersive experiences can exist on a spectrum. Start in a window in the shared space, and provide clear ways in and out of immersive experiences. 
- 🌍 Blend app content with the user's physical surroundings for a more seamless experience. Soft edges help integrate virtual content smoothly. Add animation and sound to enhance realism. 
- 🛋️ Ensure user comfort and control in immersive experiences. Avoid abrupt or fast movements, provide clear labels and symbols for guidance, and allow users to view their physical surroundings during motion. 
- 🍎 Create authentic spatial apps that utilize the unique capabilities of the platform. Make the experience engaging, distinct, and memorable by using depth, scale, and audio effectively.

# XR Accessibility User Requirements
Original article: [XR Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/)

## TL;DR
This document outlines accessibility needs for XR. The focus is on inclusivity for users with disabilities through features like motion-agnostic interactions, voice commands, and customization. XR's broad applications require addressing challenges to ensure accessibility for diverse disabilities and integrating guidelines like WCAG and WebXR API for a universally inclusive experience.

## Bullet points
1. **üåê Extended Reality (XR)**: XR encompasses immersive technologies from virtual environments to real-world augmentations. It represents the merging of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and other immersive tech. The emphasis is on its potential breadth and the need to make such experiences universally accessible to everyone.

2. **üéÆ XR Spectrum**: XR is versatile. Whether it's the immersive nature of VR using head-mounted displays that transport users to completely digital worlds or AR's mobile device overlays that enhance our real-world surroundings, the breadth of experiences in XR is continually expanding.

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Accessibility Challenges**: As XR technologies advance, there's an increasing responsibility to ensure that these experiences are accessible to all, considering users with disabilities and diverse needs. Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought but integral to XR design.

4. **üé≤ Disability in Gaming**: While XR gaming offers unprecedented immersion, it also presents unique challenges. Motion-based controls, while innovative, may exclude some users. Additionally, hardware-specific games can limit who can participate, creating barriers to a fully inclusive gaming environment.

5. **üöπ Disability Categories**: Designing XR experiences requires a comprehensive understanding of disabilities, from auditory impairments to cognitive challenges and physical limitations. Addressing the diverse needs of each category ensures a more inclusive XR space.

6. **üñêÔ∏è Multimodality**: XR stands out by engaging multiple senses simultaneously. Whether it's seeing a lifelike simulation, feeling haptic feedback, or hearing 3D audio, XR aims to create a rich, multi-sensory environment that mirrors real-world interactions.

7. **‚å®Ô∏è Input/Output in XR**: The ways users can interact with XR are diverse. Traditional inputs like keyboards and mice are joined by gesture recognition, eye tracking, and more. Similarly, outputs aren't just visual; they can range from tactile feedback to spatial audio cues.

8. **üîç Affordances**: In XR, clarity in interaction is paramount. Users should easily discern possible actions or interactions in the virtual space, making experiences both intuitive and accessible to everyone, regardless of prior XR exposure.

9. **üåç WCAG & WebXR**: As the web evolves to include XR experiences, adherence to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) remains crucial. Integrating these guidelines with the WebXR API is a significant step toward a more inclusive digital realm.

10. **üîñ Immersive Semantics**: Within XR, elements should be self-explanatory. Users, especially those using assistive technologies, should find navigation seamless, objects identifiable, and interactions straightforward. This clarity enhances the overall user experience.

11. **üï∫ Motion Agnostic Interactions**: Not all users can (or want to) rely on extensive bodily movements in XR. Designing for motion-agnostic interactions ensures that physical disabilities don't prevent anyone from enjoying immersive experiences.

12. **üé® Immersive Personalization**: Personalizing XR is especially crucial for users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Customizable overlays, the ability to mute potentially distracting content, and accommodating personal preferences can make XR more accessible and enjoyable.

13. **üéØ Interaction Customization**: Users with visual or mobility challenges might need tailored interactions. XR designs should be adaptable, offering larger interaction targets and simplifying gestures, ensuring everyone can navigate with ease.

14. **üé§ Voice & Gestural Interactions**: Voice commands and gestures offer alternative ways to interact within XR, especially beneficial for those with mobility restrictions. By recognizing and responding to voice or movement, XR becomes more universally accessible.

15. **‚úã Signing & Descriptions**: For the deaf or hard of hearing, visual communication methods, such as sign language, can be more effective. Incorporating signing avatars or providing detailed visual cues ensures these users receive the full experience in XR.
